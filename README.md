# Digital Design LABs

Welcome to **Digital Design LABs**, a personal collection of Verilog and SystemVerilog modules crafted throughout my digital design learning journey.  
This repository showcases a wide range of designs — from basic logic building blocks to more advanced modules, each crafted, tested, and sometimes even FPGA-synthesized.

---

## 📂 Structure

The repository is organized by module complexity:
- `basic/` – Simple modules like muxes, decoders, adders, counters, etc.
- `intermediate/` – FSMs, shift registers, ALUs, and small memory systems.
- `advanced/` – Complete systems like SPI interfaces, APB protocols, FIFO with assertions, and UVM environments.

## 🔧 Modules Included

Here are some of the modules implemented and tested in this repository:

### 🟢 Basic Modules
- 2:1 and 4:1 Multiplexers  
- 

### 🟡 Intermediate Modules
- Finite State Machines (FSMs)  
- 

### 🔴 Advanced Modules
- SPI Slave Interface with RAM

## 💡 Purpose

This repo serves as:
- A portfolio of my work in digital design  
- A study log of concepts I’ve mastered  
- A reference point for future projects and collaborations

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Verilog / SystemVerilog  
- QuestaSim & ModelSim for simulation  
- Xilinx Vivado for FPGA flow  
- GTKWave for waveform analysis
